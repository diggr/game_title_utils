## Title statistics

Generate statistics of common video game title features in a list of game titles.

[See title statistics README](title_statistics/README.md)

## Named entity recognition

Recognize video game titles in (English) texts, using either a dictionary-based approach or a trained machine learning model.

[See NER README](named_entity_recognition/README.md)

## Title comparison algorithm

Calculate similarity values for video game titles. The rule-based comparison algorithm is developed for taking game title specific features into account.

[See title comparison README](comparison_algorithm/README.md)
